# The order on the rationals

We prove that the rationals are a total order, and also that the ordering
plays well with the ring structure.

## The linear order on the rationals

I think that's it for non-negativity on the rationals. Let's see
if we can use those theorems about nonnegativity to prove that
the rationals are a linear order.

Next is transitivity

We now develop some basic theory of `≤` on the rationals.
Let's warm up with 0 ≤ 1.

The interplay between the ordering and the natural maps from
the naturals and integers to the rationals.

preserves and reflects `≤`. -/

lemma archimedean (x : MyRat) : ∃ (n : MyNat), x ≤ i n := by
